## Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author : Mohamed Mostafa

## Goal of the Project
 1. A tidy data set
 2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
 3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
 4. Analysis R Script
